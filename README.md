# Discovery-of-Handwashing
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital was troubled about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He felt that the cause could be due to the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies after touching the corpses.

In this notebook, using Python I have analysed the data to reconfirm that Dr.Semmelweis was right.


Datasets:

Yearly - data of the births/deaths is available for 2 clinics. Clinic 1 is the one with Medical Doctors and Clinic 2 is run by mid wives.
Monthly - data of the births/deaths for Clinic 1. 

Analysis/Visualizations are carried out to explore and prove that the proportion of Deaths reduced with Handwashing.

Concepts used: Python - Pandas, Dataframes Matplotlib PLots, Bootstrap Analysis in Numpy were used in this project
